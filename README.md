ParticleSystem
==============

A simple particle system that I created in a night. Uses Monogame and C#

It's pretty basic.

There's a Particle System object which handles the drawing and overall organization of the particles.
The emitter holds particles which will be updated upon calling ParticleSystem.tick()

There are plans to add gravity and other effectors not unlike blender's particle system
